    <h2>WHAT IS AUTONOMY?</h2>
    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:36px;font-style:Garamond;">Autonomy is a functional status given to the colleges, by the University
         Grants Commission and University. It provides greater flexibility towards
         purely academic development for upliftment of academic standards and excellence.
