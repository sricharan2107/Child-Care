    <h2>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DEEMED UNIVERSITY AND AN AUTONOMY COLLEGE?</h2>
    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:27px;font-style:Garamond;">
        A Deemed University is fully autonomous to the extent of awarding its own Degree. 
        A Deemed University is usually a Non-Affiliating version of a University and has 
        similar responsibilities like any University. An Autonomous College enjoys Academic 
        Autonomy alone. The University to which an autonomous college is affiliated will have 
        checks on the performance of the autonomous college.
